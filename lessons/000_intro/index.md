This site is an ebook to teach how to use WebGPU by building a lightly abstracted library that can be used to just render 3D objects or a starting point for a web based game engine.

### The Plan
The idea is to slowly build the ebook up with raw examples along with an abstracted version for each lesson, with the hopes that at the end you'll have a nice library to do what you want with webgpu. When its complete & webgpu is out of beta ( 09/2022 ), all the lesson will then be recorded as youtube tutorials using this written form as it's basis.
